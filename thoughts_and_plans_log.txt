starting a automated decoder and encoder biased on  a problem in linear algebra textbook.

hard coded key check

first steps encoder and decoder reading done

identity_martix comparison completed
  objective to used for proper key identification later.

encryption of a hard coded message in progress



srand(time()) and rand  // time is temporary solution
  key generation

fprintf and fscanf version later
  fprintf used for:
    key generation
    encoded encoded_output
    decoded output

  fscanf used for:
    key reading
    encoded input

  scanf used for:
    key file name
